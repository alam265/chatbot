The GenEd writing resource unit guides first and second year students to become stronger writers. It equips them with the confidence to express themselves through their writing. The resource unit offers students the opportunity to discuss the various genres of writing they must accomplish through a range of GenEd courses in the Arts and Sciences as well from an interdisciplinary perspective.  In building their confidence and independence as writers, the GenEd writing resource unit aims to help Brac students enjoy writing and see it as a valuable tool of self-expression and academic development.
The unit is structured to provide one-on-one meetings among the student, tutors and faculty members. Each session is focused on a specific assignment.  Students are encouraged (required?) to bring copies of prompts and written drafts of their work. The unit works to address students’ concerns at all stages of the writing process from brainstorming, outlining, writing the first draft, and revising.  Emphasis is given to higher-order concerns such as coming up with thesis statements, framing an argument and organizing the essay. Students are encouraged to develop self-awareness of their own recurring errors and make necessary changes independently in the future.
In addition to working with students, the resource unit liaises with GenEd course instructors at the beginning of each term to create an inventory of writing assignments. The unit assists courses with required writing assistance material and guidelines.
