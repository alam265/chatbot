The BRAC Institute of Languages (BIL) of BRAC University organized a seminar titled “Developing Critical Thinking Skills in Higher Education in Bangladesh: Rationales and Pedagogical Strategies” on the Merul Badda campus in Dhaka recently.
Organized on 3 February 2026, the event was a part of the orientation for Spring 2026 semester freshers of the Master of Arts in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (MA in TESOL) program.
Through the event, certificates were also presented to participants of the Certificate in TESL for Sustainable Development and Social Equity.
Professor Bijoy Lal Basu of the Department of English at the University of Dhaka conducted the seminar, emphasizing the need for precision, nuance, and critical thinking in academic writing in his talk.
To illustrate critical reasoning, he analyzed flawed arguments based on inadequate sample sizes, demonstrating how weak evidence can lead to unsound conclusions.
He also observed that students from literature backgrounds often rely on ornate language and verbosity, which can undermine clarity in academic work.
Professor Basu cautioned students against using vague, sweeping statements about education systems or testing practices, noting that such features vary widely across institutions and contexts.
He highlighted the importance of using hedges, such as “seems”, “might” and “appears”, to show intellectual humility when certainty is not possible, while also recognizing the strategic use of boosters when making strong, well‑supported claims.
Professor Basu concluded by stressing that critical thinking develops through practices such as writing, speaking, and engaging with feedback, helping students produce more thoughtful, responsible academic arguments.
Sarwat Reza, country head (Bangladesh), Cambridge University Press & Assessment, provided guidance on professional opportunities in language education, assessment, and publishing.
In the welcoming remarks, BIL Director Professor Shaila Sultana highlighted the need for English language teachers to address learner diversity by recognizing differences in students’ backgrounds, geography, and cultural contexts.
She also advised adapting pedagogical practices accordingly through critical thinking, ethical communication, and reflective teaching.
Moderated by BIL Senior Lecturer Farina Haque, the event ended with a cultural program.
Through this initiative, BRAC University advanced the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 4 (Quality Education) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities), promoting equitable, reflective, and high-quality higher education in Bangladesh.
