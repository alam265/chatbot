School of Law
Founded in 2004, the
at BRAC University is a gateway through which students are prepared for careers in law, in administrative services, the judiciary and in the development sector. The four-year undergraduate programme at the School of Law culminates into a
Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.)
degree for successful students. Although the primary emphasis of the programme is on law and the legal profession, given that law is also intertwined with economics, development, business and sociology, it also prepares students who are inclined to seek professions in other disciplines.
