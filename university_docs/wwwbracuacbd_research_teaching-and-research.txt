BRAC University's commitment to academic excellence and research advancement is exemplified through its "Rewarding Quality Journal Publication" initiative, a response to the Government of Bangladesh’s encouragement for research initiatives. Among the four quartiles of journals i.e. Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, the top 25% of journals are designated as Q1 (Quartile 1). The prestige of Q1 journals is attributed to their wide recognition and significant impact on research. Hence, the objective for this award is to motivate the academic and research staff at BRAC University to contribute to the top-tier Q1 journals, representing the pinnacle of research impact in each field. The emphasis on Q1 journals underscores the University’s dedication to maintaining high standards and credibility in research output.
