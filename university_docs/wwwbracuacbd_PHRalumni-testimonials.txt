"The opportunities that I received during my time as an undergraduate student in the Department of Pharmacy has shaped my thinking and understanding of applying leadership and communication skills in a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals. Especially, as a student during its nascent stages, the opportunities of teamwork and leadership roles has contributed in contributing in various pivotal roles such as Policy Coordinator of International Pharmaceutical Students Federation and Project Facilitator of the Immunization and Vaccine Development department of the World Health Organization Bangladesh Country Office during my professional career.
The well-structured Bachelor of Pharmacy (Hons) program with its link to data and evidence-based policies aiding pharmaceutical regulation and healthcare access has allowed my interest in the continued advocacy of healthcare access of chronic disease in the pathway of universal health coverage. Furthermore, the program also allowed a greater understanding of various biomedical principles aiding better grasping of epidemiological concepts and the causal web of exposures and outcomes.
These skills have allowed an advantage in successfully graduating in the Europubhealthplus program, a double Masters of Public Health program based at the University of Sheffield and Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sante Publique (EHESP), France with a specialization in Advanced Biostatistics and Epidemiology with an Erasmus+ scholarship. At present, I am coordinating projects of the RESPIRE Initiatives of the University of Edinburgh at Child Health Research Foundation where I am applying biomedical principles on the pathophysiology of respiratory disease in the surveillance of chronic respiratory conditions in 3 South Asian countries with its integration of objective clinical measurements. Additionally, the attributes of the curriculum also contribute to the development of foundational knowledge over the potential of pharmacists in various realms of the healthcare workforce. This acquired knowledge is also aiding in the continued global advocacy of the development of the investment case of healthcare students and early career professionals during my endeavors as a member of the research working group at the Global Health Workforce Network (GHWN) Youth Hub of the World Health Organization.
The extra hours spent in various competency-based learning and critical thinking have contributed significantly to the development of curiosity of continued learning of evidence-based advocacy. I will like to thank the stakeholders involved in the department of Pharmacy for providing the wonderful opportunity for concurrent academic and professional development. I will like to convey my best wishes to the amazing department for continuing such opportunities for its students in a sustainable way for their foundational development of skills and competencies."

My multidisciplinary team successfully won and the competition attracted massive media praise. The department also organizes periodic poster presentation competitions which contributes significantly to improve communication and presentation skills.

These short courses too are great opportunities to learn and network for the students.
The department also provides employment opportunities for the students. I have worked as a Student Tutor at the Department, where my role was to guide and help students, particularly those on probation. During that period, I discovered my love for teaching. In my capacity as a tutor, I successfully led many students to do better, encouraging changes in their mindset and motivating their commitment to studies, an achievement much appreciated by my supervisors, students and their guardians.

"the department helpful with students’ problems, starting from the lab assistants and student tutors to department head. I was originally interested in cancer therapeutics and largely benefitted from the laboratory and theoretical courses such as pharmacology, biopharmaceutics, and clinical pharmacy. As a consequence, I directed my project on “cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy” which was a systematic review and I am forever grateful to my project supervisor for his kind guidance. It goes without saying that my undergrad project helped me to build necessary research and computational skills which further enhanced me in the higher studies in precision oncology.

"My grandfather was one of the most renowned doctors in Old Dhaka who used to practice in the 1950s. He passed all his whole life giving free service to the poor before passing away suffering from cancer. Hearing about his stories, I was inspired to serve the people of my community by joining in the healthcare-related field. My focus to study in healthcare-related subjects got substantiated when I lost my father as well at an early age due to cancer. Since then, I was highly passionate to develop cancer therapeutics which can help thousands of people around the globe. As a result, when I was searching for an undergraduate institution, I was looking for a place which not only provides quality education but also renders me with the opportunity to take part in some cutting edge research opportunity. As an alumnus of the Department of Pharmacy, Brac University I can assure that the department has ensured active learning of the admitted students through group works, presentations, case studies, in-class debate, research projects which were supervised by world-class faculty members.
Moreover, the Department of Pharmacy of Brac University has also ensured that the students should grow holistically and that they are competent enough to solve all the real-life problems that might lie before them. The department has encouraged the students to participate in co-curricular and extracurricular activities such as Pharma Poster Challenge, Chembio Hackathon, Brac University Pharma Society, etc and also organized webinars and short courses under the ‘Toolbox for Success’ series allowing opprotunities for the students to become professionally competent. I have participated in most of the competitions and won many awards and certificates from those, but the biggest award which I received from all these events is the change in my attitude that “If you work hard, anything is achievable.” This perseverance has helped me in many ways to grow as a better version of myself such as in developing my communication skills,completing B.Pharm with high distinction, getting VC certificate in RS, passing GRE and IELTS with good scores, getting employed in Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Head office as the first person from the department. As a student, I had numerous opportunities to visit many pharmaceutical industries as part of industrial visits as well as I had the opportunity to do my internship in the very renowned Eskayef Pharmaceuticals Limited. This has guided me to apply my theoretical knowledge in the practical field and helped me understand better my responsibilities as a student. This understanding has given me a competitive edge over others to perform well and fulfill the responsibilities proactively in my current occupation. Also, during my tenure as General Secretary of the departmental club (BUPS), I got the opportunity to participate in many activities as a volunteer such as in Winter Dimple, Cleaning Buriganga, Flood Relief Donation, etc and was able to share my experiences in one of the most popular public platforms in Bangladesh known as “People’s Radio”. These opportunities have improved my presentation skills for which I would always be grateful.
Lastly, I have no hesitation in saying that I have passed the best time of my student life in the Department of Pharmacy, Brac University and I still get overwhelmingly proud when I reminisce my days as an undergraduate student. If it was possible, I would have gone back to those days of mine as a Brac University student. I would always consider studying at the Department of Pharmacy as a blessing and would always try to uphold the reputation of the department as an Alumnus by performing well just like the other alumni of the department."

"My academic journey began in the Department of Pharmacy, BRAC University, back in 2017. There was a saying in scientific communities that “The greatest scientists are also the greatest dreamers; to turn those dreams into success needs willpower.” When I started my studies, it was my dream to become a researcher who understands how human physiology works, how diseases progress, and how to create medicine to treat illness. I had the willpower to achieve my dream, but all I needed was guidance and mentorship, which I received from the Dean, Professor Dr Eva Rahman Kabir and the esteemed faculty members of the School of Pharmacy.

Even during the challenges posed by the pandemic, I had the privilege of contributing to society. Additionally, serving as a Teaching Assistant closely aligned with the department was a professionally enriching experience that undoubtedly left a lasting impact on my career. I had the honor of being involved in the pivotal transition from the Department of Pharmacy to the School of Pharmacy—a pioneering initiative in our country and BRAC University history led by Professor Kabir. I firmly believe that with her at the helm, the School of Pharmacy at BRAC University will emerge as a leader in education and research across Southeast Asia in the future, representing both BRAC University and Bangladesh on a global scale.
Currently, I am pursuing an MSc in Molecular Medicine at the University of East Anglia, UK, while also working on a research project focusing on the development of enteric neurons from iPSCs and studying their functional interactions with different organoids and gut stem cells for my master’s thesis. In the future, I aim to give back by contributing to the school and creating comparable opportunities for upcoming researchers and leaders in the field of pharmacy at BRAC University.
For those considering a career in Pharmacy, I understand that the prospect may seem challenging, involving cutting-edge research to deliver optimal patient treatments and a rigorous curriculum. Nevertheless, I can assure you that the School of Pharmacy's supportive atmosphere and educational environment will empower you to realize your full potential."
