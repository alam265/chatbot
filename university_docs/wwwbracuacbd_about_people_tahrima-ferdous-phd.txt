completed her BBA in Management (2007) and MBA in Management Information Systems (2008) from the University of Dhaka. In 2009, she moved to Australia, where she worked as a tax consultant with H&R Tax Accountants for five years while also completing a Diploma and Advanced Diploma in Accounting from TAFE Sydney.
She later pursued an M.Phil. at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) on a full scholarship, focusing on flexible work arrangements, followed by a PhD at QUT (completed in 2025) on a full scholarship, specializing in remote work and organizational control. Her doctoral research examined how changing work arrangements shape management practices, employee wellbeing, and organizational performance - issues highly relevant to contemporary organizations.

Her teaching approach emphasizes critical thinking, ethical leadership, inclusive workplaces, and the practical application of research-informed knowledge.
