EBM Research Group will be involved in the search for the best research evidence for healthcare practitioners to make informed decisions about prescribing drugs for the care of individual patients.
Our overall aim is to help in clinical decision-making to provide
‘the right care at the right time to the right patient.’
We are committed to the continuing education and life-long learning of healthcare professionals and patient communities for
better treatment outcomes,
reducing healthcare costs and
ultimately improving the quality of life of patients
Our Goals:
● Provide high-quality evidence that benefits patients and the community
● Improve diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of common diseases
● Generate relevant outputs that can update current clinical practice
● Design tools and methods for easy understanding of healthcare findings
The multidisciplinary team includes researchers from different fields of expertise: medicine, clinical pharmacology, biostatistics, and epidemiology.
The EBM group researchers will
identify multiple studies on a selected clinical topic
separate the best ones
critically analyze them
summarise the best available evidence.
This will help health practitioners to select treatment options for specific cases based on the best research, patient preferences, and individual patient characteristics.
