Bachelor of Arts in Applied English Language Studies (BA in AELS)
Program Overview
The goal of the 4-year, 12-semester, 132-credit Bachelor of Arts in Applied English Language Studies (BA in AELS) program is to produce functional graduates and bilingual, multilingual global citizens with strong English proficiency, critical thinking, effective communication, problem-solving abilities, rhetorical sensibility, research and analytical skills, and knowledge of innovations, policies, and interventions from/in the Global South. To produce lifelong learners who can contribute to the language industry and have a positive social impact while exhibiting UNESCO's essential competencies for sustainability, the BA-AELS curriculum places a strong emphasis on sustainability, inclusion, linguistic rights, diversity, educational equity, and social justice.
With 21 credits for a Major and 12 credits for a Minor, students can earn a BA in AELS (General) or select one of three specializations:
English Teacher Education and Development, or
Leadership and Management in Language Education, or
Translation and Interpretation.
In addition to 39 credits of General Education courses, the program consists of 54 credits of core courses in language, linguistics, applied and advanced linguistics, pedagogy, educational psychology, English literature, technology in language education, research methodology, and foreign language proficiency. Additionally, students can participate in a mini-scale research project, take electives, and do a six-credit dissertation or internship in their final year.
Three Specialization Pathways
English Teacher Education & Development
This area of specialization focuses on theories, hands-on practices and research on English language teaching. With a Major in this specialization, graduates will become skilled English language professionals through hands-on training in modern teaching methods, curriculum design, materials development, and assessment—with strong foundations in pedagogy, research, and innovative and technology-enhanced classroom practices.
Leadership & Management in Language Education
The goal of Leadership and Management in Language Education is to develop expertise needed  to succeed in dynamic and rapidly evolving local and global language education contexts. A Major in this specialization prepares graduates for roles such as language program administrators, education project leaders, project managers, academic coordinators, and leaders in ESL, adult education, and language centers in English-speaking and non-English-speaking environments.
Translation & Interpretation
Students interested in language services in regional and international contexts are the target audience for Translation and Interpretation. Studying in the Translation and Interpretation stream will helps them become proficient in intercultural communication, translation, and interpretation and develop multilingual proficiency in Bangla, English and a third language: Chinese, French, Spanish, Japanese, German, Korean, Italian, or Arabic. Our graduates will also develop the linguistic subtleties needed for literary, legal, medical, and technical translation. In this specialization, students also study translation theories and practices, real-time interpretation, the use of AI technologies, and translation memories.
Across all specializations, the BA in AELS program emphasises advanced ICT skills and emerging technologies in language education, which allow graduates to demonstrate multimodal and digital literacies in their jobs.
