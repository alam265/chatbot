BRAC University's commitment to academic excellence and research advancement is exemplified through its "Rewarding Quality Journal Publication" initiative, a response to the Government of Bangladesh’s encouragement for research initiatives. Among the four quartiles of journals i.e. Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, the top 25% of journals are designated as Q1 (Quartile 1). The prestige of Q1 journals is attributed to their wide recognition and significant impact on research. Hence, the objective for this award is to motivate the academic and research staff at BRAC University to contribute to the top-tier Q1 journals, representing the pinnacle of research impact in each field. The emphasis on Q1 journals underscores the University’s dedication to maintaining high standards and credibility in research output.
The program, initiated in January 2023, operates under the supervision of the Research Metrics Committee (RMC) which ensures fairness and integrity in the evaluation process. To be eligible, at least one author needs to be affiliated with BRAC University, and the topic researched will need to align with the University’s research priorities.
The selection process is meticulous, involving shortlisting, document verification, and evaluation by the RMC. This process ensures that funds are directed towards publications aligning with the University's research objectives, fostering a purposeful and impactful research culture.
The "Rewarding Quality Journal Publication" initiative by BRAC University is a comprehensive approach to elevate the institution’s research profile. By recognizing excellence in research through this award, the University is actively fostering a thriving research environment for the benefit of its academic and research community which ultimately contributes to the individual as well as the institution’s success.
