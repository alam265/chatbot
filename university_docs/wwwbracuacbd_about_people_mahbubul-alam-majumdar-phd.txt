Level: 4, Room: 4G33
Kha-224 Merul Badda
Dhaka 1212. Bangladesh
I am a mathematician with a wide array of interests. My interests in computer science are development oriented -- how can we use computer science techniques and compuational power to make the lives of Bangladeshis better?  My academic interests are in string theory, early universe cosmology, quantum computing and machine learning.
For those wanting to work with me or do a thesis, an outline of my interests is below.
Computer Science
Machine Learning
Computational Finance
Cryptocurrencies, Blockchain and related ideas
Quantum Computing, Quantum Algorithms and Cryptography
Theoretical Physics
String cosmology
Black Hole Information Paradox and Quantum Information Theory
Singularity resolution
Resurgence and non-perturbative phenomena
Mathematics
Elliptic curves, Modular forms and Moonshine
Game Theory, Auctions and applications of game theory to social sciences
Sampling techniques and polling
One of my primary goals is the guiding of  the best mathematical and scientific talent in Bangladesh and the creation of a community of extremely capable Bangladeshi mathematicians, theoretical physicsists and computer scientists. I am MIT's Regional Coordinator and the National Coach of the Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Team. I try to contribute to nation-building by injecting technical sophistication into the business and financial spaces and supporting entrepreneurs by finding them financial support and providing technical expertise to turn their ideas into successful companies to create a modern Bangladesh.
I have taught a wide array of courses ranging from Machine Learning to Number Theory to Quantum Field Theory.
