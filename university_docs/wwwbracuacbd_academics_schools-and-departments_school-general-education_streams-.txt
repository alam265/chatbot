The New Streams and Courses for the General Education Program = 39 credits (13 courses)
GenEd courses are divided into five streams. The chart below highlights the courses that belong to each stream. The first four streams consist of courses that are furnished by various departments at BRAC University, and have been taught as GenEd and elective courses in the past. This new GenEd scheme has a new addition: the Community Seeking Transformation (CST) courses. The CST courses are the capstone interdisciplinary courses and the teaching and learning they hold up will conclude the GenEd cycle and allow the students to understand and appreciate the importance of their GenEd education well into their adult lives. This new stream offers topical courses (on food and nutrition, wellbeing, peace, conflict and justice, religion, arts and history, corporate anthropology, etc.) that are beyond the confines of any one academic disciplines. These topical courses will engage a combination of academic approaches (anthropology and philosophy, history, philosophy and politics, anthropology, economics and politics, etc) to bring alive the course topics, discussions of problems and the creative search for solutions.
The course listing including the minimum requirement from each stream are as follows:
