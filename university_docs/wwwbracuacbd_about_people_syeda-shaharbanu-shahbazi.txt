is an educator and consultant with over a decade of teaching experience. She is a senior lecturer at BRAC Business School and her specialization is Finance. The courses she offers are Entrepreneurship, Financial Management, and Business Communication. A valedictorian of the MBA 35th batch at IBA, University of Dhaka, and a graduate of Schulich School of Business, York University, Ms. Shahbazi  combines academic excellence with real-world impact.
