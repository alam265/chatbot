Counseling and Wellness Centre
Mental health counseling does not just treat a condition. It is a therapeutic procedure where counselors address the causes that create psychosocial conflicts in life. Counseling is a process that takes place in the context of a helping relationship in which people can identify more effective strategies to deal with their feelings and emotions, work on their thoughts, and modify behavior as well as foster personal growth and awareness.
