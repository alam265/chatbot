Experiential learning is a unique aspect of the School of GenEd. It consists of a mixture of interactive teaching methods, participation in workshops, seminars and conferences and visits to field sites, local museums, cultural festivals and performing arts venues.
Through such engagements students are sensitized to the world around them, especially the social, economic and environmental challenges faced by people in Bangladesh. Experiential Learning helps students become analytical and skilled at solving complex
problems through collaborative interventions. Students gain confidence and develop a better understanding of themselves as part of a broader local and global community.
The Experiential Learning experience encourages students to explore sustainable solutions and embrace a diversity of thought and practice. It fosters creativity of expressions through a critical appreciation of alternative practices. Students also gain empathy through an examination of the ethical implications of their actions.
